## Description

I looked for a Skadis right angle connector, and while I found two, there were issues with both of them.

The first one I found was beautifully rounded, but didn't have an easy way to hold the washer in place while tightening the bolt.
The other one didn't join the pegboards flush to each other.
Neither of them had insets for hex socket head caps.
The bolt is M3x16.

The washer for this model is sized to match a #17 hex socket to make tightening them very easy.  The hex nut fits VERY snugly in the washer, I use pliers to seat them, they aren't really press-to-fit, but I wanted them tight because I didn't want them to strip out the washer, and I didn't have square nuts, which would have been more suited for this application.

I put everything together reasonably loosely on the pegboard, and then position everything like I like and then tighten them up using the hex socket on a ratchet.  I love the way they turned out.

I put one set at the top and one set at the bottom.
